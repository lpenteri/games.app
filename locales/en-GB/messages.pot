msgstr "<p>Help Lydia the Librarian quickly find books for the kids. The kids' word bubbles tell you which books they want. But the books aren't labeled, so you need to memorize the location of each book!</p><p>If you like this game, you might enjoy the School Supply SNAP game which also trains short-term memory.</p><p>HOW TO PLAY. Bring the books to the kids before they get upset and leave. Drop any unwanted books into the Return slot.</p><p>You are Lydia the Lightning Librarian. Let's hope you can live up to your name.</p><p>Your job is to provide students with the books they ask for. But it's not going to be easy.</p><p>These students are impatient. They become angry and frustrated if you don't get the book to them quickly.</p><p>And they'll leave in a huff if you take too long. If 5 students exit the library without a book, it's game over.</p><p>Worse yet, the books in this library are not organized by subject, title, or card catalog number. The titles don't even appear on the side of the books. All you have to go on is your own memory.</p>"
